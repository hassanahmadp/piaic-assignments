// Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. *** Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
interface MusicAlbum {
  artist: string;
  album: string;
  tracksCount?: number;
}

const make_album = (artist: string, album: string, tracksCount?: number): MusicAlbum => {
  return tracksCount ? { artist, album, tracksCount } : { artist, album };
};

console.log(make_album("The Beatles", "The Beatles: The Next Generation"));
console.log(make_album("Any are you okay", "Bad boys", 17));

export {};
